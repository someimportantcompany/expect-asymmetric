## Required tooling

When working on this service you'll need the following tools installed:

| Dependency                    | Version |
| ----------------------------- | ------- |
| [`node`](https://nodejs.org/) | `20.x`+ |
| [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io)     | `10.x`+ |

- **Recommendation:** [Install `corepack`](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) to manage package
  manager versions between repositories.

## Installing dependencies

To install the dependencies for the entire repository you can run the following command in the root
of the repository:

```sh
$ pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

## Working locally

- Unit tests should cover the fine-grained details of the package, and be as detailed as
  possible.
- Integration tests should act as a sanity check that the built package is functioning as
  expected.

### Unit Tests

repository:

$ pnpm run test:unit
```

### Building

### Integration Tests

## Pull Requests

When you've got some changes pushed to your branch, it's time to open up a pull request!

To get started, open a PR comparing `main` with `your-branch`.

**Your PR will need to be approved by another contributor**, so the more detail you here add
the better!

### Pull-Requests workflow

When your PR is opened, the [**Pull Requests** workflow](./.github/workflows/pull-requests.yml) will
trigger, which will:

- Install dependencies
- Build the package
- Run the integration tests

### Merging

Once your PR has successful [Pull-Requests](#pull-requests-workflow) üü¢ runs, and has been
[approved](#approvals) ‚úÖ, you are free to merge your PR whenever you're ready.

Once your PR has been merged into `main`, the [Release workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml)
will be triggered, which will:

- Install dependencies
- Build the package
- Open a new PR for Changesets to bump package versions
- Merge that PR to publish new package versions

‚ö†Ô∏è You may wish to
[enable auto-merging](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request)
for your PR, however you must follow the PR's progress through into publish.
